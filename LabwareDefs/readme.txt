these labware definitions are very custom.
Michael created them using the opentrons labware creator, 
16-Jul-2021: and then I (Noah) modified them with my bare hands (vim). If you ever need to revist this (I pray you do not) I you should revert commits to this date and use the files in the Temporary_Plate_Reader_Index_Manipulation.
If you find yourself in that situation, my heart goes out to you. Best of luck. you shall need it.
