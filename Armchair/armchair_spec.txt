COMMAND TYPES

x00: 'init'
    Description: This command tells the server to construct an Ot2Controller instance.
    Args:
        bool simulate: True is simulating   
        bool using_temp_ctrl: True if using temperature control
        float temp: the temperature to keep unit at
        df labware: labware information see OT2Controller.__init__
        df reagents: reagents information see excel spec

x04: 'transfer'
    Description: This is used to perform a transfer operation as in the excel sheet
    Args:
        str src: the chemical_name of the source well to be transfered from 
        list<tuple<str, float>> transfer_steps
        list<str> callbacks: the ordered callbacks to perform on this operation, or None

x05: 'init_containers'
    Description: This is used to initialize container(s) for a new reaction.
    Args:
        df product_df:
            INDEX:
            str chemical_name: the name of the rxn. initializes container for each row
            COLS:
            str labware: the type of labware this reaction must go in. If None, platereader will
              be used unless no space or too small in which case something else will be used.
            float max_vol: the maximum volume that will every ocupy this container. If not
              specified, some container will be found
