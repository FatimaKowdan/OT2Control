Test the bejesus out of what we have
    write some nice sheets
Error Exits
    implement server side error handle
    implement client side error handle
    litter code with try excepts
build in some error checking
    what does michael's code do? just checking if you have enough reagent? I can proabaly
    run and try/except at the end

    THROW ERRORS WITHIN CONTAINERS
    platereader should have 200 ul. Check at each scan]
    make sure you have enough to run reaction
handle the tube problem
    do you want to be able to specify size of tube you want? I could (ouch) just put in smallest
    You probably only want to specify size/container_type. Maybe I look up which labware has those
    how to handle error of tubes since you've got vol at the bottom will not show up on error
      check. User responsibility? Can we integrate over the bottom? Do we even need to? can we
      just call the height the bottom of the tube at that point and suck from there?
      SOLUTION: get a dead volume for every container. go to bottom and recalculate. 
create class for the controller
Implement the Pause
Block_On_Ready should probably be part of Armchair
Fix the yucky state of caching. i.e. redesign the controller stuff to be more functional, and 
  make any i/o strictly in it's own function
