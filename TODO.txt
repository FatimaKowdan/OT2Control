CRITICAL
Fix Robot python

PRIORITY

FUTURE
platereader should have 200 ul. Check at each scan]
Use logger to log messages
Error Exits
    implement server side error handle
    implement client side error handle
Update UML diagram and review protected vars/funcs
Block_On_Ready should probably be part of Armchair

NOTES
We've mostly fixed the tube problem, but for ML, where you really just want a container 
  (any container) to accomodate volume, we'll probabaly need to revisit
  this. I recommend
  a new class LabwareType that has a list of labware objects and finds the best one

DISCUSSION POINTS
We have the capacity to not pickup new tip on each transfer if same reagent if you wish. Sure Implement it
Would love a picture of each labware type
