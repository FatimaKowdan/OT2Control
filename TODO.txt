Error Exits
    implement server side error handle
    implement client side error handle
build in some error checking
    what does michael's code do? just checking if you have enough reagent? I can proabaly
    run and try/except at the end

    check to make sure you don't end up with two reagents in same container
    check also that the user never specified an undefined deck position
    check also that the mass always provided. Just throw a lot of assertions at the sheet loading
    Check that stock solutions exist by the time you call them

    THROW ERRORS WITHIN CONTAINERS
    platereader should have 200 ul. Check at each scan]
    make sure you have enough to run reaction
create class for the controller
Implement the Pause
Block_On_Ready should probably be part of Armchair
Fix the yucky state of caching. i.e. redesign the controller stuff to be more functional, and 
  make any i/o strictly in it's own function
We've mostly fixed the tube problem, but for ML, where you really just want a container 
  (any container) to accomodate volume, we'll probabaly need to revisit
  this. I recommend
  a new class LabwareType that has a list of labware objects and finds the best one
With regard to the platereader interface? Make sense? No. You should go through plate dict
4 milimeter start for tube depth
Header for input Template?
We have the capacity to not pickup new tip on each transfer if same reagent if you wish
Would love a picture of each labware type
