CRITICAL

PRIORITY
Pipette Mixes
dry reagent
Test pr
Get data loaded
Look at data and do feature engineering. ignore the 400
look at bares add

FUTURE
When we start pipetting from wells, we're gonna want a DEAD_VOL
inputs should all be wrapped in while loops
Use logger to log messages
Error Exits
    implement server side error handle
    implement client side error handle
Update UML diagram and review protected vars/funcs
ploting the metadata
drop metadata on reaction on exit

NOTES
We've mostly fixed the tube problem, but for ML, where you really just want a container 
  (any container) to accomodate volume, we'll probabaly need to revisit
  this. I recommend
  a new class LabwareType that has a list of labware objects and finds the best one

DISCUSSION POINTS
We have the capacity to not pickup new tip on each transfer if same reagent if you wish. Sure Implement it
Would love a picture of each labware type
Would be nice to implement some timing calculator that prints expected time at end of simulation
