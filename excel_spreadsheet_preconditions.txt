INPUT TEMPlATE
worksheet 0 is the input template
an operation is transfer, scan, or pause
any element that is transfered shall be renamed with spaces replaced with underscores, and it's concentration appended in the format 'C0.003'
Every one of these reagents will be queried.

REAGENTS INFO
reagents concentration and reagent names will be pulled from the input template
You are responsible for entering the type MUST BE ['stock', or 'mix'] and if it is a product ['yes','no'] (you want eve to produce it)
If it it not a product, you are expected to supply mass of tube with the reagent, position on the labware, and position on the deck. mass is expected in grams with cap
If it is a product, you may specify position on labware and/or position on deck, but if you do not, eve will choose these for you.
All products with concentrations are dilutions, so they will have water measured out for them at the start (because 'add acid' and any other chemical?).
The chemical to be diluted with then be added JIT (just in time) directly before it it is used. (saving on tip economy)
You can put comments, but eve won't read them

DECK POSITIONS
You must choose from the dropdown menu. If you want to use two of same element, no problem.
You must always specify the first tube/tip ("A1" if you are full)
